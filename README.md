# TrueWorld
TrueWorld is a game that I am developing, based on information from the "Pick Me Up!"manga. Even if the source code is written by AI, I've always wanted to get a little touch on the game itself. Link to manhwa in English: https://mangabuddy.com/pick-me-up

**Download and play in one click:**

1.  Download the latest `TrueWorld.exe` file.
2.  **Simply double-click** the downloaded `TrueWorld.exe` to start playing.

> **Note for Windows:** When you run the file for the first time, Windows Defender or your antivirus might show a warning because the file is from an unknown publisher. This is normal for games distributed this way. You need to click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to launch the game.
